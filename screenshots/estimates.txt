Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage would be nil as the RDS DB master with standby spans two allowing one to continue operation 
in the event of a single AZ outage. Minimum RTO for the a region failue would be 15 minutes as manual operation is required in the event 
that the master DB region went down. The replica in the second region then could be manually promoted to take over "write" duties. 
In ours scenario, we did not automate this yet yielding the time for manual opertion. Minimum RPO, measured in time to recover from 
loss of data in the case of an AZ failure or region is nill as there is no data loss. Either switching to standby for AZ failure and 
promotion for Region failure. As the promotion process should insure that all replacants completed. Additionally, clients will receive write 
errors at the time of failure thus preventing new data from entering.
